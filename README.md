# INTRODUCTION TO API'S

API (Application Programming Interface ) is a way for decoupled applications to communicate with each other.    
A decoupled application is an application whose components are developed, tested and deployed separately.   
The decoupling can be based done on a couple of factors:
 - Backend or frontend (the frontend and backend are developed and deployed separately)
 - Modularity (the applications modules (different logical aspects of an application) are developed separately i.e for a POS system the Sales, Inventory, User and other modules are developed and deployed separately)    

The API provides a gateway for the decoupled applications to communicate.

One application will send data the other and the other will consume the data via the API and Vice Versa.    

It's important to note that there 3 most notable types of API's.    
    - REST (Representational State Transfer)      
    - SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)   
    - RPC (Remote Procedure Call)   
Our focus will be on REST API's which is the most widely used but just to pique your curiosity the difference between the 3 lies in their architecture specification.  

## REST 
Rest is a constraint base architecture for creating web APi's.
